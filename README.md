# astrometry-sextractor-tester

This project is meant to provide a stripped down version of KStars' image loading, sextracting, 
fits parameter loading, image rendering, and astrometry solving algorithms.

The goal is to try to incorporate sextractor and astrometry libraries into this testing ground to get plate solving to
work independently of the command line programs and python3 to make it faster, more reliable, and possibly best of all cross-platform
with Windows.
